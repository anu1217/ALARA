***Please review this schedule hierarchy.!!!!!!!!!!

Schedule 'myschedule':
	pulse: 10 s with 12 s delay pulsed with history single_pulse
	pulse: 10 s with 3 s delay pulsed with history single_pulse
	pulse: 10 s with 5 s delay pulsed with history single_pulse
	Schedule 'sub_1' with 5 s delay and pulsed with history 'triple_pulse':
		pulse: 5 s with 0 s delay pulsed with history double_pulse

***End of schedule hierarchy.
