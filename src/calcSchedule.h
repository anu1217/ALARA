/** \brief This class is used to create a linked hierarchy of schedule
 *         information.  Each calcSchedule object represents a portion 
 *         of a potentially complex irradiaiton schedule.
 *
 *  Some notes on the creation of calcSchedule objects from the Schedule
 *  and ScheduleItem objects of the Input.
 *
 *  1. First, a calcSchedule object is created for each Schedule object
 *     in the input, by counting the number of ScheduleItems and
 *     initializing it with that size.  We will call these TYPE A
 *     calcSchedule objects.  TYPE A objects have no delay and no
 *     pulsing history.
 *
 *  2. Then, for each Schedule object, the list of ScheduleItems is
 *     parsed, and a new calcSchedule object is created for each
 *     ScheduleItem, and pointed to by the list of pointers in that
 *     Schedule's corresponding calcSchedule object.  There are two
 *     possibilities for these: a single pulse (nItems=0) or a
 *     sub-schedule (nItems=1).  We will call these TYPE B-0 and TYPE
 *     B-1, respectively.
 *
 *  3. During steps 1 and 2, the top Schedule in the hierarchy is found
 *     and its corresponding calcSchedule object is converted to a
 *     topSchedule object (derived from calcSchedule).
 *
 *  4. Finally, starting with the single topSchedule object, the
 *     hierarchy is traversed in a depth first search and the
 *     calcSchedules are "collapsed" to remove superfluous levels which
 *     have only single sub-items.  There are two (more?) cases where
 *     this is applied: TYPE A objects with single sub-items, and all
 *     TYPE B-1 objects.
 *
 *     TYPE A objects with single items point to one of the TYPE B
 *     variants: TYPE B-0 implies that a single pulse type object is
 *     being conveniently defined for reuse, while TYPE B-1 implies less
 *     than optimum user input, with a single schedule nested inside a
 *     schedule.  Since TYPE A objects have neither pulsing histories or
 *     delays, the act of collapsing these is functionally the same as
 *     replacing the TYPE A with the TYPE B object.
 *
 *     TYPE B-1 objects all point to TYPE A objects, and are combined with
 *     that TYPE A object, copying the list of sub-items from A to B,
 *     but retaining the pulsing history and delay of the TYPE B-1
 *     (since TYPE A objects have no pulsing history or delay).  We will
 *     call these TYPE B-A objects.  
 *
 *     Note that this collapsing happens from the top down, so a TYPE
 *     A(1) -> TYPE B-1 -> TYPE A(N) hierarchy will first be collapsed
 *     to a TYPE B-1 -> TYPE A(N) hierarchy, and then recursively
 *     converted to a TYPE B-A.  This also means that the lower object
 *     in the hierarchy is unchanged.  This is important since such
 *     objects could be pointed to by many calcSchedules, and they need
 *     to be collapsed independently.
 *
 *     At the end of the collapsing, the only possible TYPE A object
 *     will be a topSchedule.  Of course, if it has only one item, then
 *     it will be collapsed to a TYPE B-0 or TYPE B-A object.
