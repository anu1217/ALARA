/** \brief This class is invoked as a linked list and describes the 
 *         various geometrical intervals of the problem.  
 *
 *  Each Volume object is a member of two lists: the first is 
 *  problem-wide (a member of an object of class Input) and has the 
 *  Volume objects in the order they were input or created 
 *  (see Dimension::convert()), and the second is a list of intervals
 *  for each mixture.  The first element of the main problem-wide list
 *  has type VOL_HEAD (defined through the volume member), and contains
 *  no problem data.
